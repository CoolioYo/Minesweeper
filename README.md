# Minesweeper

This is the Minesweeper game with graphics coded in Java. It has 3 difficulty levels, flags, a timer, and sound effects that you can toggle on and off. You are guarenteed to never hit a mine on your first turn. It's not perfect, but this is my second project in java that uses GUI, so I'm happy with how it turned out.
